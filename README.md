# Assign and a print a variable

In this quick exercise, you will use the what we learned in the previous lesson to assign and print a variable. 

You may [refer to Monday's lecture notes](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/variables-getting-started-9-4-23.md) to complete the exercise. However, I would advise against copy-pasting, so your fingers can start to build muscle memory. 

## Instructions 

1. Sign in to your [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) account
2. Create a new Python trinket by clicking the dropdown by your username on the top right then New Trinket>Python
3. Write a program that declares a variable called y and assigns it a numerical value. 
4. Draw two boxes with the same y coordiante, using the variable created in step 3. 
5. Save your work, and copy the link from the link-share tree to the left of the Save button. 
6. Paste your link from step 4 into LINK.md and commit your changes.
