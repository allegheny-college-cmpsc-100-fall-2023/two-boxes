# Two Boxes

In this quick exercise, you will use the what we learned this week two draw two boxes with the same y coordinate. 

You can reference Wednesday's [lecture notes](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/comments-and-shapes-9-6.md#shapes-in-vpython) when completing your assignment. Note that I am asking you to do something different than what's in the lecture dmeo, but that uses the same syntax and principles. 

## Instructions 

1. Sign in to your [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) account
2. Create a new VPython trinket by clicking the dropdown by your username on the top right, then New Trinket>Web VPython>Python
3. Declare a variable called y and assign it a numerical value. 
4. Draw two boxes with the same y coordinate, using the variable created in step 3. 
5. Save your work, and copy the link from the link-share tree to the left of the Save button. 
6. Paste your link from step 4 into LINK.md and commit your changes.
